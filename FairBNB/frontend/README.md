# frontend

This folder holds the code for the frontend.  
  
`components/` holds code for individual components. There are four components - form, map and compare that corresponds to home, map and wish list screen in our app. We also created filtering components to handled filtering codes isolatedly.  
`icons/` holds icons and images used by the frontend.  
`mapViewOverride/` holds a modified source file from the mapview module, which we had to modify.


# Programming languages and frameworks we used 
## Python
## Kivy & KivyMD
Kivy is an open source, cross-platform Python framework for the development of applications and KivyMD is a collection of Material Design compliant widgets for use with Kivy.
We pick the Kivy since it provides interactive map widget which is the core components in our application. We also found that KivyMD supports various built-in components and widgets which make our development easy and quick.
